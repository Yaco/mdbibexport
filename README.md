# mdbibexport
mdbibexport.pl extracts the cited references of a Pandoc markdown document and writes a bibtex database for this document. The keys are extracted from the markdown file and written into an auxiliary file, which is used by BibTool to find the references in the bibtex (.bib) data base and to write them into a new file.
## Requirements
BibTool <http://gerd-neugebauer.de/software/TeX/BibTool/en/>, Pandoc <http://www.pandoc.org/> and Perl <https://www.perl.org/> have to be installed on the system. Version 2.65 of BibTool, version 1.16.0.2 of Pandoc and version 5.25 of Perl have been tested with this script.
